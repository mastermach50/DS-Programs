# Linear Search

#### Aim:-
Write a program to conduct linear search in a user defined array of integers.

#### Algorithm:-
1. START
1. Get the number of elements in the array and store it as n.
1. Loop from i=0 to n and get each element in the array and store it in an array called arr.
1. Get the item to search for and store it as search.
1. Initialize i=0.
1. Loop from i to n and check if each arr[i]==search, if it is then print i and break from the loop.
1. If i==n display that the element was not found.
1. STOP

#### Result:-
The program executed successfully.
